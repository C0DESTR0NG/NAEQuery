# NAEQuery
NAEQuery is a lightweight algorithm that helps highlight significant words or phrases within a paragraph or excerpt. The algorithm sums up the New Aeon English Qabala cipher equivalent letter values for each consecutive set of two, three, and four words. The result set outputs an array of word combinations and their summed NAEQ cipher values.


### Order & Value
```
A=1   B=2   C=3   D=4   E=5   F=6   G=7   H=8   I=9   J=10  K=11  L=12   M=13  
N=14  O=15  P=16  Q=17  R=18  S=19  T=20  U=21  V=22  W=23  X=24  Y=25   Z=26
```


The algorithm highlights all words or phrases that equal **112**:

`112 = WE ARE ONE, the code phrase that tells you you’re in important territory`
